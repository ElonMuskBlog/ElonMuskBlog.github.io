        Like I said at National Governors Association, "The thing that drives me is that I want to be able to think about the future and feel good about that," "that's what really drives me — trying to figure out how to make sure that things are great and going to be so." I just want the future to be the one we dream of.

        Time to relax with my children and play video games! I'm planning on building a model rocket with my kids and then I will go watch a movie. Tomorrow I will support Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and do the Ice Bucket Challenge with my kids... they say they have something creative in mind.

        With my rocket launch success I am back on track to having a smooth path. X.com or now know as Paypal was a huge success and Tesla is going great. I am happy to have you guys supporting me with The Boring Company to build underground tunnels.

        Why do buy/make the company's that I do? The short answer, I am trying to make the future the one we dream of. Long answer, I don't want to sit on an island all my life, I would have to be on serious drugs for that. Instead I like helping the world accomplish the future we dream of. I want to be part of it and not just watch it happen.

        I am remembering how I was bullied in school. It was horrible, I was lonely and my only friends betrayed me. One gang would follow me for years until I moved. I had good grades and read a lot of books but that didn't change the fact that I was the go to bully kid.
